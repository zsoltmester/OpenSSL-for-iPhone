# OpenSSL Wrapper for iOS

A wrapper framework for the OpenSSL library for iOS. The framework **supports only iOS** (doesn't support watchOS, macOS or tvOS). Forked from https://github.com/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone. All credentials for Felix Schulze for the `build-libssl.sh`.

## Build

You can rebuild the framework with the following steps:
1. To build a static library: `./build-libssl.sh --version=1.1.0f`. For all options, run the script with the `--help`.
